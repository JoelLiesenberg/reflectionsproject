                    <p>
                        Hello, and welcome to "Reflections," a short collection of stories inspired by the reflections of 5 fictional Warriors
                        of Light in "Final Fantasy XIV." All Warriors of Light are chosen by Hydaelyn, the Mother Crystal, and are reflections
                        of her, numbering in the millions. Millions of unique reflections cast across The Source and beyond. And while these
                        5 stories only touch on 5 of millions, they offer valuable insight into how gender and sexuality are brought forth
                        through both the developers of the game, as well as the all-important relationship between player and character.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You are welcome to read as few or as many of the stories as you'd like, and in any order, but for the most curated
                        experience, it is recommended that you proceed in the order they are presented across the top navigation bar. Upon
                        your reading, should you encounter grey, underlined text and you don't know the meaning or context of that word or phrase, 
                        I invite you to click on said text, and a pop-up message will provide you with the needed context/meaning. I
                        hope you enjoy these reflections, from some of the Mother Crystal's chosen, and the players who created them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each of the five stories is primarily set in a distinct location within the game world. "Millions" takes place in the portside pirate capital of
                        Limsa Lominsa, and follows the story of Asuna and her player as they grapple with the queering of timelines and identities between them. "Another Cat-Girl" is set in the quiet and pastoral woodland city of Gridania
                        and follows Calico and her player as they navigate this world for the first time, the player community surrounding them, and the unexpected barriers and nuances that come with being a cat-girl. "The Crab Sees The Bird..." is set against the far eastern kingdom of Kugane,
                        and is the story of two childhood friends whose budding non-normative romance and dreams are inherently at odds with the hyper-normative city they inhabit. "Choco Bro's Big Dumb Game" starts in the bustling and vibrant textile
                        and alchemical haven of Radz-at-Han, and follows Choco Bro, a grifter and transactional player who uses race and gender, and the promise of something deeper, as a means to an end. And finally, "To Join the Unbodied Song" takes place in a place far removed from this world, on the
                        surface of the moon, Mare Lamentorum, and follows the disillusionment of the "freedoms" afforded to players and characters, and contends with the purpose of the body in the forming of identity.

                    <p>
                        Seeing as how this project thus far only represents five of literally millions of Warriors of Light scattered about 
                        The Source and beyond, I hope to continue adding more stories and reflections from other locales and orientations.
                        Every Warrior of Light, though but one reflection among millions, tells a different tale, and I look forward to
                        collecting those millions of reflections one day.

                        Read on to learn more about "Final Fantasy XIV", the survey what began this journey, and me, the player behind the project. Thank you,
                        and I hope you enjoy.

                <h2>The Game</h2>
                <p>
                    Final Fantasy XIV is an MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game) developed by major Japanese video game developer, 
                    Square Enix. It is a juggernaut within the field of contemporary Japanese games, pulling in tens of millions of players,
                    something only western MMOs like "World of Warcraft" have historically been able to do. MMOs generally operate on two
                    fronts to tell their stories: the developer front and player front. The developers create the world, lore, questlines,
                    and NPCs (non-player characters), but it falls to the player to create their own character and build their own story
                    within the dev-created world.
                </p>

                </figure>
                <p>
                    The very firt choices players will make are part of this character creation process. As of this project, if players have purchased the
                    base game, as well as each subsequent expansion, players have access to 8 races to choose from, as well male and female 
                    variations of each race (except for Hrothgar, which are male-only as of now, though female Hrothgar have been announced to
                    be released at a later date). Once players have chosen their race and gender, they are greeted with a bevy of customization
                    options. Players are immediately incentivized to form a personal bond with their character through this deep system, and since
                    they will ostensibly be spending thousands of hours with them, it makes sense that strong bonds will be formed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the player has finished creating their character, they are set loose into the world. Players choose a starting combat
                    class, which determines their starting city, but all classes can be unlocked for all characters and can be switched between
                    at any time, so even that is left to the player to decide. What makes "Final Fantasy XIV" stand out from other MMOs is the
                    lengths it goes to to involve your player character in the main storyline, since narrative has been such a heavy focus of
                    the Final Fantasy series since its inception. What makes this difficult in MMOs, though, is that since the world has to accommodate
                    literal millions of these player characters, with entirely player-created backstories and personalities, writing a coherent
                    narrative with the player character as a central force is quite difficult. Because of this, most MMOs involve the player's character only
                    tangentially, treating them as a nobody kind of character who's along for the ride while other characters actually propel the plot, which dampens the bond between player and character. "Final Fantasy XIV" throws this standard completely out the window,
                    though, and your character is the literal fulcrum point of the entire game.

                <p>
                    This video shows an early cutscene where the player character is introduced to the god of this world, Hydaelyn,
                    the Mother Crystal. Hydaelyn commands the character to hear, feel, think, etc. and chooses them as her Warrior of
                    Light, her champion. And so, even though there are millions of other players experiencing this exact same choosing,
                    you feel like your character is someone special to this world. Thus, your character becomes intrinsic to both the player front,
                    being completely customizable and a conduit for the player to experience the world through in whichever way they see fit, but also
                    to the developer front, playing a central role in the overarching narrative being told. This makes "Final Fantasy XIV" a fascinating
                    game to do this kind of analysis on, in my opinion, and offers a lot of interesting perspectives for me to incorporate into
                    these stories.
                </p>
                <h2>The Survey</h2>
                <p>
                    With this project, I was interested in looking at how all of these elements come into play when determining the player/character relationship
                    as it relates to gender and sexuality. Do you create an intricate backstory for your character? Why did you choose the race and gender that you did,
                    and how do those choices fit in with the lore and society of the game, but also within player communities? Is you character a reflection of you, or
                    a different version of you, or completely unrelated? And then, with an item called 'fantasia', players are able to completely do-over this creation, and create
                    a new character while keeping all of their gameplay accomplishments and progress, so how does this item change things?
                </p>
                <p>
                    To answer these questions, I sent out an informal survey to several friends who are other players of the game, to get
                    a sense of how gender and sexuality plays a role for them in the creation of their characters. Based on the responses I received, as well as my own
                    experiences within the game, and through thinking about these concepts over the course of the semester, I wrote this collection centered around five fictional players and characters. Here
                    are some of the question topics I included in the survey:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What race/gender combo is your main WoL (Warrior of Light), and have you played as any other races/genders?</li>
                    <li>If yes, why did you switch, and how many times have you switched?</li>
                    <li>What is the name of your WoL, and what kind of backstory have you created for them?</li>
                    <li>If you haven't created a backstory, why?</li>
                    <li>Does your WoL's race/gender play an important role in their backstory?</li>
                    <li>What are stereotypes/assumptions that come to mind for certain races/genders (e.g. cat-girls)?</li>
                    <li>What is your investment in the glamour system (explained in the stories), and does clothing play a role in your character's backstory?</li>
                    <li>What is your opinion on gender-locked or race-locked gear (gear only usable by certain genders or races)?</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>The Author</h2>
                <p>
                    The desire to do a project like this came from my personal and academic interest in Japanese video games as not only
                    individual art pieces, but also as representatives of contemporary Japanese literary/visual culture. I have previously,
                    in a past project, examined the relationship between player and character from the perspective of a different Japanese game,
                    and how the developers of that game purposefully manipulated that relationship to get across the themes/narratives of the game, using
                    the very concept of video games as an element therein. For this project, I wanted to take a more creative approach, and examine
                    the more personal nature of this relationship as it relates to gender/sexuality, and how the player navigates their own identity
                    and ideas within a world and digital society developed by other people who have their own identities and ideas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Final Fantasy is one of my all-time favorite series, and I have been playing "Final Fantasy XIV" since about 2018-2019. I play
                    a male Miqo'te (aka cat-boi) named Winter Belles, but started as other races and genders before settling on this one. It has always
                    interested me why players create the characters that they create, and why, if at all, that has any bearing on their personal identities
                    outside of the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some of these stories are from the player perspective, some from the character perspective, some a mixture of both, etc. I wanted
                    to explore and analyze as many different relationships and ideas as possible, and I could have easily written many more stories. This project
                    ballooned over the course of the semester into something much bigger than originally planned, but it has been such an enjoyable and fascinating
                    experience looking at this game from so many unique perspectives. So, apologies for the length, but I hope you enjoy this short collection of stories. Thank you.
