                    <p>
                        The Drowning Wench is always of a raucous sort, sailors and traders shouting and tossing ales back, 
                        hostesses scurrying trays and emptying glasses. Tonight’s no different. We sit to ourselves at a table near 
                        the back, just the two (well, three) of us, removed enough to hear our whispers, but close enough to allay 
                        suspicion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He cocks his head at Asuna, a quiver of a smirk brushed across his face. I never trusted him, not from 
                        the jump. But when I’d heard tales of his crystal phials…
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Aye, aye I have it. Had to bust a few heads over at the docks cause my friend wanted to go rogue, but it’s here.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There’s the briefest of flashes from his bag, a dazzle of prisms catching the light of the lanterns. Then it’s gone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Asuna reaches her hand out dazedly, and I can’t stop her. I’d reach my hand out too if I could. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He pulls the bag shut and closer to his side.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Now now, no need for haste, dearie. It’s yours, paid in full, but let’s just enjoy the night a bit longer, eh?”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Paid in full. Paid with millions of <span class="footnote" onclick="javascript:alert('Gil is the main currency of this, as well as the most games in the Final Fantasy series');">gil</span>. Gil collected across thousands of hours of adventuring, from the 
                        eastern reaches of Kugane, to the far west of Eorzea, and to the moon, the literal ends of the universe, 
                        and back. Millions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I got my start here in <span class="footnote" onclick="javascript:alert('Limsa Lominsa, ne of the three main starting cities that players can begin their journey at. Themed as a port-side city with a loose alliance of pirates.');">Limsa</span>, working as an arcanist for hire, healing parties on their exploits. 
                        No one paid me much mind as long as I did my job, and depending on the quest, I’d make a few hundred 
                        gil per voyage. Hyurs tend to be invisible anyway, blending into the cream of the human sea. When I made Asuna 
                        a Hyur, I didn’t really think much of it. Strive for realism, and all that. I modeled her like me; medium 
                        build, rusty hair, bracken eyes. It made sense. Asuna was always meant to be me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The fantasy came with the <span class="footnote" onclick="javascript:alert('Players choose a starting battle job when creating their character, but can unlock and level all throughout the game, switching when they want on the fly.');">jobs</span> and quests, hopping from spell-slinging summoners to greataxe-wielding 
                        marauders, even to samurai and astrologians for spells. I climbed the peaks of Sohm Al, wrestling with 
                        dragons, and plunged the depths of the Ruby Sea, rescuing possessed princesses from the sunken Shisui 
                        palace. What other Hyur can say that they’ve done what I’ve done? What Asuna’s done?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But after the fortune’s been made, and the reaches of the world and beyond explored, what was once 
                        comfortably normal has become decidedly not. No matter how many thousands of hours Asuna and I spend 
                        immersed in fantasy, the gulf between us never stops growing. As those thousands of hours continue to 
                        flow, I have metamorphosed, evolved, changed, but Asuna has remained stagnant.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I explore old haunts for more fantastical and outlandish <span class="footnote" onclick="javascript:alert('Glamours are a game system where players place clothing items in a glamour dresser and can make their gear look like any clothes inside, so players can wear high-level gear, while making it look however they want; often shortened to glams');">glamours</span>, I dye her hair, I purchase tomes 
                        to teach her dances and <span class="footnote" onclick="javascript:alert('Canned animations for specific actions that can be unlocked, learned, or purchased. Oftend differ based on race and gender. Dances are some of the most popular and most sought after.');">emotes</span>, anything to bring her with me. But in the end there is still that 
                        abnormalcy between us sucking at the core beneath the clothes woven from starlight and plated with meteors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And so I spent millions of gil.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Millions for Asuna and I to be we again.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Millions for a fantasia.

                        In all my wandering I had never heard of something by that name. It was an old friend, Red, who’d first 
                        spoken of it. One night, down in Reisen, that temple under Hells’ Kier. A modest temple, for sure, but 
                        housed in a glittering cave beneath the volcano. There’s no sun, no moon, just the everpresence of stars 
                        across the ceiling made from fluorescent fungi.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The deities living there had challenged us to calm the great firebird, Suzaku. We’d returned with news of 
                        our success, and the gods granted us time to rest before journeying back to the surface. There was a point 
                        in the day, or night, when our backs were against the gate, and we were staring up at the fungal stars when 
                        he said it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “You ever hear of fantasia?”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I had Asuna tell him I hadn’t.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Well it’s this…this…well I don’t really know what you would call it, actually. I’ve never seen it. But 
                        apparently it comes in these crystal phials. And when you look through the crystal, you see these little 
                        sparkly wisps just floating around, millions of them.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Millions. Millions of sparkly wisps. I looked up at the dots of blue fungi hanging above me and imagined 
                        millions of glowing spores swirling up and around through the air, gently settling into a prismed phial, capturing 
                        all the fluorescence inside.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “It sounds beautiful.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Yeah, I’m sure it is, but that’s not what it’s for. The magic doesn’t start til you open the phial.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was the last time I saw Red. We’d never been inseparable or anything, so I wasn’t surprised, necessarily. 
                        Just occasionally partying up should our paths cross. I heard through the shipyard grapevines that he’d found 
                        it. He’d found a fantasia. And then they never saw him again.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That was the odd thing about it. Not that I never saw him, but that no one else did either. Red was also a Hyur, 
                        taller, broader, blonde, but he wasn’t one of the invisible Hyur. Sure, upon first glance he blended 
                        perfectly into that bland human sea, but unlike Asuna, he thrived there.

                        He started here in Limsa in the rogues’ guild, learning to use his natural invisibility to his benefit. 
                        We met on one of his scouting missions for the guild. Outer La Noscea, on one of the islands. He needed 
                        a healer to keep him alive from a distance while he snuck into a pirate crew’s camp. Something about a 
                        stolen trinket of some value.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I watched him from atop the cliffs, occasionally casting <span class="footnote" onclick="javascript:alert('Healer jobs are generally separated into two categories: shield and pure healers. Shield healers are preventative, placing shields to soak potential dammage.');">shields</span> on him when he was discovered, but mostly 
                        just watching him work. Two daggers drawn, measured crouch, awareness of the wind so as not to alert 
                        the hounds, and finally graceful knife-slashes from the darkness.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We struck up a friendship from there, tipping each other to possible jobs and running a few treasure hunts 
                        on our own. There was an end to it, though, this one time after a plunder. We were sitting by the docks 
                        here in Limsa, watching the ships go by.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “I think I’m leaving.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thinking nothing of it, I had Asuna chime in with a “where to? What’s the job?”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Staring off into the setting sun, he sighed into a chuckle. “Who said it’s a job?”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Then what is it?”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “I got an offer. From the guildhead. He wants me to train with a sect of ninjas in Kugane.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Kugane. I–Wow, that’s…that’s far.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Yeah, yeah it is…and it’ll be for some time.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It made sense. There was only so much the rogues could teach him, and the ninjas in Kugane were legendary, 
                        using <span class="footnote" onclick="javascript:alert('Mudra is a gameplay mechanic only accessible to ninjas, and one of the available mudra combos turns the player invisible to sneak attack enemies.');">mudra</span> to literally turn invisible. In a way it was the natural course of action for someone who
                        so reveled in being unseen. He knew how to be a Hyur, he celebrated being boring. Did he ever think it 
                        was boring? I actually don’t know. Probably not, knowing him, or at least who he used to be.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That was the last I saw of Red until our encounter with Suzaku and our respite under the fungal stars. When 
                        he told me of fantasia, how it can change you in ways thought impossible. And he found it, if the whispers 
                        of sailors and traders are to be believed. But no one could ever find him again to confirm. Or maybe 
                        they did, but they didn’t know it was him. I like to think I’ve passed him since, a ghost in the wind, 
                        finally having achieved the zenith of the Hyur.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I don’t understand it, and yet I do, because here I am, trusting this man in front of me to be good on 
                        his word, to not cheat me of my millions for millions. He’s taking his time, chewing the battered fish slowly, 
                        drinking his frothy ale in tender sips. He’s enjoying this. Can he see it writ on Asuna’s face? How 
                        much we need this?

                        ‘Lovely little Hyur girl.’ I suppose Asuna is that, but it feels odd on my tongue. The blandness has taken 
                        on a sour note, a spoiled note, a curdled note. Do we tell him? Do we tell him about our dreams? The ones that 
                        started soon after returning from the temple? Long white shadows fluttering across my eyes, phantoms of 
                        mint-green and sky-blue revealed beneath? Asuna reborn, stasis broken, moved through time, standing tall on the 
                        prow of her ship, sloughing and letting the lovely little Hyur girl drift into the sea of cream she rides upon? 
                        But how do we tell him that, yet also explain what lies beneath the slough? When Asuna has caught up to me, 
                        what will be left when the lovely little Hyur girl has been discarded?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Instead of answering, Asuna and I glance around the room. There’s an open walkway extending out along the upper 
                        decks from the tavern, the salt-white pillars of the city breaking the horizon-view of the sea. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Not breaking our stare at the water, I have Asuna speak through tears “please. I’m tired. I’ve already paid. 
                        Just give it to me.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I don’t see his face, or his reaction, but the chewing stops, and I hear the glass clunk on the table. A long 
                        sigh, the chair creaking. “Alright, you don’t want to talk, fine. A man of my word.” And then, as if blown 
                        in with the briny wind, the lantern on the table goes out, a package wrapped in oil-cloth is pushed into 
                        Asuna’s chest, and the man is gone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I let Asuna stay there for a moment. Feel the weight of the package at her breast, let out a sigh that rides along 
                        the breeze, chasing something only the wind could know. The moment passes, and Asuna and I get up, and walk 
                        out along the upper decks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Limsa isn’t a home. It never has been. I got my start here sure, but so does every other adventurer. 
                        It’s a hub of transients: sailors, hunters, merchants, navies, mercenaries, pirates, and those with no choice 
                        but to be among them. When a large majority of my days are spent roaming, and the rest in the inn just off 
                        the tavern, it’s not a home, it’s just another port, but one you circle back on time and time again. I have 
                        passed through this city nigh on a hundred times, and each time, no matter the loot, the spells, the glamours, the 
                        party, the anything, I am still seen as Asuna is seen, because Asuna does not change. And if Asuna does not 
                        change, then do I change? I can leave her here, asleep in her bed in the inn, or in her cabin on some ship, or 
                        wrapped in her bedroll in some gods-forgotten corner of the world, and I can continue. But upon my return, Asuna 
                        is where I left her, the same as she ever was. We adventure, and watch the world change around us, always new 
                        places, new people, new experiences, and yet all the transience in the realm won’t change us.

                        But a fantasia will.

                        I lean on the railing along the upper decks, looking out over the <span class="footnote" onclick="javascript:alert('Aetherytes are giant blue crystals that form the nexus points of cities and zones.

                        hundreds of adventurers appearing and disappearing, coming and going, conducting their business and heading 
                        out once more. So much motion, so much time, and yet no ultimate change. It’s exhausting after all these years.

                        He called Asuna a lovely little Hyur girl. He called me a lovely little Hyur girl. What is the sour point at 
                        play there? When I was Asuna, back at the beginning of our grand adventure, all of this would have rang true. 
                        So what has curdled into a misnomer?

                        Am I lovely? I think Asuna would say she is. But am I? That’s maybe not what my mind would go to 
                        immediately. Lovely is definitely sour. Lovely is infantilizing, objectifying, breakable. Lovely is 
                        the <span class="footnote" onclick="javascript:alert('A porcelain doll turned monster, fought as part of a questline.');">Calcabrina</span> doll on master Matoya’s mantle, not a trauma-hardened fully realized human. Lovely is almost 
                        paradoxically the anti-Hyur in that sense. But in any case, no, I am not lovely.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Am I little? Physically, I can’t say that my stature has changed dramatically, but I feel bigger in ways. Ways 
                        that still don’t quite make sense. Is it a bad thing to be little? A pebble against a boulder, a puddle 
                        against an ocean? If a pebble doesn’t gain sediment, can it claim to be a boulder? If the rains don’t flood a 
                        puddle into an ocean, can the puddle claim it? Little is sour, though I can’t explain why.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Am I Hyur? On the surface an easier question to answer. Since the human equivalent in this world is Hyur, it 
                        would fall to reason that I am Hyur. But still the sour persists. There is more to being Hyur than being 
                        human. Human is the only option I have, and Hyur is but one for Asuna. All of what makes a human is 
                        scattered across multiple races here. So what does being a Hyur say to my humanity that another race 
                        may say differently?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Am I a girl? No. No, I don’t think I am. Is that a revelation? Is this the heart of the sour? Is this the piece 
                        of Asuna’s skin that doesn’t fit quite right anymore? Is Asuna only serving as a reflection of a life I’ve 
                        since left behind? Asuna has been living a life of rotations and circuits, always coming back to the same 
                        aetheryte in the same plaza in the same Limsa in the same life. The same life, no matter how many gods she 
                        slays or how many empires she fells, she will still come back to Limsa, nothing within or without her 
                        changed except her clothes and weapon, and the circle will continue, unbroken, when next I log on. And as her 
                        circle continues, mine has broken free from its course and new cycles have begun and broken and begun again. 
                        And one of those constants of hers is her girlhood and one of my inconstants is mine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I open this fantasia, when I let the millions of fungal stars spill forth, what will Asuna become? Someone 
                        bigger, rougher, but still gentle. A Roegadyn, with mint-green skin and sky-blue eyes. Still a healer, but 
                        with more of a marauding streak. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And what should happen when I grow too far from Asuna the Roe? When the hope of a fantasia has been lost?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I try not to think about it.

                    <p>
                        And if I do, I hope that another phial of stars is out there somewhere.

                    <p>
                        But before I worry about the future, I’ll uncork this one here, under the sky of actual stars, with the brine of 
                        adventure borne of the winds of change on my tongue.

                <h2>About:</h2>
                <p>
                    “Millions” was the first story I ended up writing for the project. One of the things I wanted to incorporate 
                    throughout these stories was how different identities besides gender/sexuality impacted this player/character 
                    relationship alongside gender/sexuality. I wanted 
                    to examine the interwoven nature of different elements within the game, especially race and gender since those are 
                    the first two choices that a player makes in the character creation screen.
                </p>
                <p>
	                One of the main responses I got about the Hyur race from my survey was that 
                    the race is super plain and super boring. I took that sentiment and ran with the idea of a player creating a Hyur 
                    character in order to have a character as similar to them as possible, but then since the character doesn’t 
                    change, and the player does, this similarity between the player and the character drifts until they’re ultimately 
                    not similar anymore at all. The passage of time in the real world has allowed Asuna’s player to realize their 
                    changing and nuanced relationship with gender and identity, and are in the process of realizing that Asuna is, at 
                    best, a relic of how they used to perceive their gender, and at worst, a reminder of past forced normativity. 
                    It’s through this embrace of fantasia and the harnessing of the inherent fantasy at play within the game that helps 
                    Asuna’s player to break free from that normativity and revel in the queerness of playing a hyper-masculine 
                    Roegadyn named Asuna who is a healer (though there is an argument to be made that since the game is so fantastical, 
                    playing a Hyur is actually the non-normative/queer option, but I thought the direction I chose provided a better 
                    framework for understanding this as a human).
