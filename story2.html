                        Oh Mother Hydaelyn, your creation is so small.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I look upon it from my lunar perch, where the <span class="footnote" onclick="javascript:alert('The Watcher is a character tasked by Hydaelyn to sit on the moon and watch over Zodiark in his cage, as well as keep an eye on the world.');">Watcher</span> did his watching, and wonder.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Do you regret the sundering, what split your world in twain, casting thirteen reflections across thirteen planes? 
                        <span class="footnote" onclick="javascript:alert('Ancient/fancy name for the game world.');">Etheirys</span> in its prime must have been a marvel to behold.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But now I sit and see what’s left of <span class="footnote" onclick="javascript:alert('Colloquial name of the world.');">the Source</span>, the core reflection, my home, and I can only see a husk of what 
                        once was.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Do you know I’ve been to <span class="footnote" onclick="javascript:alert('Late-game zone with significant lore implications.');">Elpis</span>? Do you even remember Elpis? The land of creation? A sanctuary for all that your 
                        people made? I went there with Elidibus’ help, to witness Meteion’s flight and Hermes’ protective wrath. 
                        You were there, as you once were, a woman splendored in white.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Elpis was lost to us in the sundering. When you gave up your body, apotheosizing to your crystalline godhood. Do you miss it, 
                        Elpis? Do you miss your body?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I don’t miss mine. But really, what body was mine to begin with? I’ve gone through so many 
                        by this point that I can barely remember. Though I must have been a Hyur when traveling to Elpis. A man by 
                        the name of Red. I chose the name Red for no particular reason. The red sand of Thanalan that I saw from the 
                        carriage into <span class="footnote" onclick="javascript:alert('The name of the third starting city, after Limsa Lominsa and Gridania. Thanalan is the desert region the city resides in.');">Ul’Dah</span> is just the first memory I have. Where I was born, how I came to be on said carriage, my 
                        name, all of these things that should have existed were nothing. All I knew was I was heading to the city to 
                        be an adventurer. So Red was nothing more than a placeholder. A necessary thing to mark an unnecessary being.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You, oh Mother Hydaelyn, you tricked me, though. You called me forth before your grand crystal, and proclaimed 
                        me your champion. One plucked from millions to hear your echo, and answer your call. I saw myself reflected 
                        in your dazzling fractals, this nameless entity given purpose by the protector of all.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I see your creation from here, watch the clouds as they whorl in their same patterns, and the seas as they 
                        churn in their same currents. All differentiations, all twists, all tangles in your weave are microscopic 
                        from here.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It’s all so small and insignificant.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your promise to me was much the same. I saw myself reflected by the millions, but slowly those reflections turned 
                        to others. More and more naive adventurers with nameless faces graced your divinity, until I was only one 
                        among millions, relegated to a single reflection.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I was the best at what I did, an invisible Hyur, an orphan of the world. I made the body that you called 
                        champion into something befitting the title. I sank into the slurry of faces and bodies like mine and ruled 
                        within that invisibility, hoping that you would approve, that you would call to me, your champion, and 
                        put this body you chose to use. An orphan with no identity remade as a Warrior of Light, the light from your 
                        crystal shining upon this body, giving it purpose and acclaim.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I felt free with your blessing to travel the ends of your world, do the quests you needed doing. You were trapped 
                        in your subconscious crystal stasis, and I was the body through which your bidding was done.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It felt like a freedom, at least. It felt so freeing, being able to go from realm to realm, both invisible 
                        to the masses, but so strikingly visible to you, our mother crystal. It was so freeing. Freeing, that is, until 
                        I saw the millions of others doing the same thing. Until I became invisible within your visibility. Until my 
                        millions of reflections gradually lessened, one by one, until my reflection was but one in the grand sea 
                        of your chosen. And then the freedom became like a chain, where you commanded my body to go from point to point, 
                        and by giving you my body I was powerless to break free from my freedom.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And so here we are, two beings sundered from bodies. In ways, we both chose this whispered existence. You to 
                        save the world, and I to save myself. One trapped within acorporeality and one freed by it. This, dear mother, 
                        is true freedom.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After defeating the darkness in <span class="footnote" onclick="javascript:alert('Capital of the empire that serves as the primary antagonist for several portions of the game.');">Garlemald</span>, you called me and the <span class="footnote" onclick="javascript:alert('Group of NPC allies you team up with in the story.');">Scions</span> here to Mare Lamentorum. You called
                        us to the moon to keep true darkness enchained, and when that darkness succeeded in breaking its 
                        bindings, you called us to kill it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And we did.

                <p>
                    But then upon resting, deep in the Watcher’s archives, I discovered something. Crystal phials filled with crystal 
                    dust. Brilliant, shimmering dust. I asked the Watcher, but he could not tell me. I asked <span class="footnote" onclick="javascript:alert('All four of these characters are members of the Scions you fight alongside.');">Y’shtola</span>, but neither 
                    could she. I asked Krile, G’raha, Urianger, all versed in <span class="footnote" onclick="javascript:alert('Aether serves as the main energy that flows through all life, and is a major lore element.');">aetherology</span>, and yet none could point to where this 
                    dust could have come from.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Which leaves only you and your “body,” dear mother.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why? Why give us this tool to change our bodies? The bodies you chose as your champions? If this body was worthy of 
                    being your Warrior of Light, then why shed flakes of your crystal so we may alter it?
                </p>
                <p>
                    I pondered this for ages, wasting away the hours atop the Watcher’s perch, staring out at the marble of existence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You asked me to visit the <span class="footnote" onclick="javascript:alert('Moon-rabbits that help as part of the MSQ.');">Loporrits</span>, to get their help in averting the Final Days. But I said no. Instead, I 
                    returned to Etheirys and connected with old friends, fellow adventurers, sank back into old habits. But I had 
                    my own mission in mind.

                        Asuna seemed troubled. Different somehow, though I don’t think she knew just yet. I hinted at the phials, gave 
                        her a hope she didn’t know she needed. Sometime later, on our final meeting, I told her I was off to Kugane. 
                        A lie, but her troubles and attentions were turned inward, the truth would have broken her if she’d been willing 
                        to come up for air.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another friend, Calico, I think she saw through me. At least a bit. She always had sharp eyes, and even 
                        sharper claws. She glared her daggers at me, her tail twitching all the while, but gave me her blessing when I relented.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My travel to Kugane wasn’t a total lie in the end, though the stop was more temporary than my friends had been 
                        led to believe. Yoshi was there, of course, and we sat atop the hostelry again, looking out over the city and 
                        up to the castle. He was Yoshi about things, chattering away about his potential love life, a clandestine 
                        flirtation he’d struck up. I didn’t even need to say anything. He’s never one to stop talking, but a lot gets 
                        said in between the words with him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My last stop before returning to the moon was one final trip to the deep Thanalan desert, to see the sands what 
                        gave me my placeholder. There I met another adventurer, albeit of a different sort. I don’t remember his 
                        name, but he spoke of riches and boons, of grandeur and glory. I made mention of secrets on the moon, and he 
                        was vanished before the sentence had left the air. I wonder if I made a mistake there.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I tell you these tales, oh mother Hydaelyn, so you put names to just some of the millions of bodies you make 
                        servants and soldiers of. Because as I was watching from the Watcher’s perch, I realized why you gifted us these 
                        phials, why you gifted us fantasia.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because you didn’t choose these bodies. This body of mine is not your champion. You chose this body because it is 
                        a body, and only a body. The name, the race, the gender, the build, the job, none of it matters in the end, 
                        because all of us have what you gave up. A body. You give us fantasia so that we may be appeased, so that we may 
                        feel that we are free to choose our identities, so that we may feel as if we are evolving. It’s placation so 
                        that we don’t realize that our freedom only extends so far. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And so I realized our dichotomy. For you to not have a body leaves you enchained, and thus for me to have a 
                        body leaves me enchained.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So I chose to lose it.

                        After my final tour of your creation I came back to this perch above the world, and for the first time I heard 
                        the voices. Bodiless voices in the vacuum. And I promised them that I would be joining them in their song, 
                        ere long.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mare Lamentorum. The Sea of Lament. A misnomer for the ages, because these voices, oh these voices, mother, they 
                        sing songs of reverie, songs of joy. As I made my way to collect the fantasias, I began to leap with 
                        weakened gravity in anticipation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I made my way here, to my perch, with countless phials in my grasp. It took longer than I thought it would to will myself to 
                        open the first. A long moment of doubt.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Do you hate me, mother? Do you hate me for choosing this eternal liminality? For refusing to finish your quests? 
                        I can see shadow of flame and decay spreading across your creation, engulfing all you hold dear within that 
                        little marble, the apocalypse nigh. I can see it happening, and it gives me pause, but just for a second. Because 
                        I know you have countless others in this grand reflective sea of yours. Even should you hate me, the loss of 
                        my body will amount to no less than a single drop being evaporated. Someone else will finish your quest, someone 
                        else will save Etheirys and all you hold dear. And I will be free.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The cork came out easily, and before the crystalline ephemera could escape, I lifted it to my face and breathed 
                        in the fractaled cloud.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Immediately the voices grew stronger, the song louder.

                    <p>
                        I awoke no longer as Red the invisible Hyur male, but as Ellara the Viera maiden, tall and slender, 
                        with ears reaching up into the heavens.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I breathed in another phial, this time becoming Brutus the Hrothgar lion, my face wrapped in my mane, and my fur 
                        patched with battle scars and burns.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then I was Kimiko, a Lalafellian girl, with cherub cheeks, neon hair, and a strong, absurdly cute, gremlin energy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Faster and faster, phial after phial, body after body, Elezen to Miqo’te to Hyur then back to Elezen, male to male 
                        to female to male to female to female, everything in constant succession until each body became as a flicker, 
                        like millions of leaves all fluttering in the wind, all at once, flashing from body to body, blending together 
                        into a fuzzy novaic mass of energy, setting the surface of the moon alight with the brilliance of another sun.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And then nothing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The sun extinguished, the roulette of bodies stopped, the phials emptied.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Oh Mother Hydaelyn, your creation is so small.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So small, as I sit here, watching from the Watcher’s perch, letting my acorpeality spread where it may, truly and 
                        finally free to join the unbodied song.

                    From when I first came up with the concept of framing everything around reflections, I knew I needed to 
                    incorporate Hydaelyn somehow, and this critique of the body was how I went about realizing it. Red being 
                    simultaneously the most in tune with his character’s identity, while at the same time, being hopelessly lost in 
                    a liminal space due to his disillusionment with the “freedom” afforded by Hydaelyn to the player character 
                    was my favorite thing to explore in this project. 
                    How, in the end, even though he has decided to quit the game, and sever the relationship between the player and 
                    character, he still sees everything from his character’s perspective, directly critiquing Hydaelyn’s championing 
                    of the player character and the hollow importance placed on their identity, since he sees it all as ultimately worthless when you 
                    always have the ability to change to something else. The question left hanging is does his perception of the 
                    worthlessness of the defined gender/sexuality/identity extend beyond the lore and character to the player 
                    himself, since the two were so intertwined, or is there still an importance to identity outside of the game?

                    I chose to have this story set in Mare Lamentorum, since this is my favorite zone in the game from a visual and auditory
                    perspective. I will often sit where I had Red sit and listen to the music track ("One Small Step", which served
                    as inspiration for the idea of joining the song made up of those who gave up their bodies) for hours at a time, or while doing other things, like homework. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYO3vjv60NI" id="music_link">Here's a link to listen
                    if you're so inclined</a>. To me, it is the most reflective zone in the game, and the idea of literally being able to look
                    at the developer-created world from afar, and question everything, seemed too perfect to pass up.
