                        so many people just leaving their characters everywhere, really breaks the illusion. Ooh, love that sit animation. 
                        Can’t wait to see what kinds of emotes there are. Okay, this seems like a nice quiet spot, be right back.

                        Okay, cool, so marketboards are the auction house of the game. I have like no gil, but may as well see what’s for 
                        sale. A guy can dream. Hm, oh here’s some level 1 gear. Only need 2k gil, too. Can I try it on? Hm, looks okay, 
                        but weirdly strappy and super revealing. So it’s that kind of game, huh? Figures. Oh this one looks more normal. 
                        It at least has, I dunno, fabric that covers skin? Can’t expect level 1 stuff to look too interesting, I suppose. 
                        Lemme just see what it looks like when I put it–Oh, that’s weird, it’s not letting me. What the hell? Wait, is 
                        that…is that a male symbol there in the description? Gear is gender-locked? O-okay then. Guess I’ll keep 
                        looking…Okay, cool, there’s some fun looking stuff, and if I remember correctly, Ty said I could unlock dyeing at 
                        some point, so this armor would probably look pretty nice with some, like, dark-blue or something.

                        Oh apparently missed a text from him. “Mic broken, we can talk in chat once we add each other to friend-list.

                        at the aetheryte.” Aetheryte? “The big crystal thing. Really hard to miss.” Oh yeah, that big blue thing I had 
                        to connect to. “Yeah, that. My character is named Hiro Ofsong. I’m a big lion dude.” Okay, cool, I’m Calico

                        Um…Okay then. Didn’t think it was such a strange choice, but I guess female Miqo’tes have a reputation, or 
                        something. Welp, too late to change now, and I think she’s cute, so fuck it.

                        <span class="bold_text">Calico Whiskers:</span> Haha thanks, didn’t realize it was gonna be, ya know, a deal<br>
                        <span class="bold_text">Hiro Ofsong:</span> Nah nah, you’re good, just didn’t expect it from ya is all. You 
                        struck me as more of a male Au Ra type or something. You know, dark and broody and giving strong edge-lord vibes<br>
                        <span class="bold_text">Calico Whiskers:</span> I give strong edge-lord vibes? Really?<br>
                        <span class="bold_text">Hiro Ofsong:</span> Yeah, like you’re a really chill dude, but like, ya know, edgy

                    <p class="italic_text">
                        Edgy? I don’t think I’ve ever once described myself as edgy. Like, I have a beard, shaved head, tattoo sleeves, 
                        a decidedly masculine energy, but…Wait has Ty ever even seen a picture of me? I guess I do have a pretty deep 
                        voice, and I’m not the most talkative person over VC, but that’s just cause I’m awkward, not cause I’m edgy.

                        <span class="bold_text">Hiro Ofsong:</span> Ready to get going? I can carry you through the first

                        <span class="bold_text">Calico Whiskers:</span> Sure, let’s do it. Found some armor I really like, 
                        but need some gil first<br>
                        <span class="bold_text">Hiro Ofsong:</span> Oh neat, what’s the set? I may be able to buy and trade it to ya now<br>
                        <span class="bold_text">Calico Whiskers:</span> Uh, Viera Harness<br>
                        <span class="bold_text">Hiro Ofsong:</span> Oof, yeah, no, sorry, you won’t be able to wear that<br>
                        <span class="bold_text">Calico Whiskers:</span> Wait, what, why?<br>
                        <span class="bold_text">Hiro Ofsong:</span> Cause it’s the starting gear for Viera males. All the starting gear is 
                        race/gender locked<br>
                        <span class="bold_text">Calico Whiskers:</span> Well that fucking sucks<br>
                        <span class="bold_text">Hiro Ofsong:</span> Yeah, it’s a drag, but thankfully the gender-locked stuff tends to 
                        taper off once you reach the higher levels, and the devs are working on retroactively unlocking some of the 
                        old stuff. Though the starting sets will probs stay locked, unfortunately. But don’t worry, you can start 
                        getting some mildly cool stuff by like level 20 when you start unlocking dungeons<br>
                        <span class="bold_text">Calico Whiskers:</span> Really? I have to wait til level 20?<br>
                        <span class="bold_text">Hiro Ofsong:</span> Yeah all the stuff until then is pretty uggo<br>
                        <span class="bold_text">Calico Whiskers:</span> Wow so fun<br>
                        <span class="bold_text">Hiro Ofsong:</span> Hey, no worries, since I’m already max-level, I can take you into 
                        some high-level zones and we can grind out the first 20 levels easy-peasy. Also, you could always hop on the 
                        market-board and buy the Emperor’s New set<br>
                        <span class="bold_text">Calico Whiskers:</span> Emperor’s New set?<br>
                        <span class="bold_text">Hiro Ofsong:</span> Yeah it’s a level 1 glam set that removes clothes, except 
                        underwear, of course. Good for beach glams or joke glams. Also since you’re a cat girl, good for sexy 
                        glams<br>

                        Oh–Oh god, ew, what the fuck? I didn’t choose Calico cause of that! I–Why did I go with a cat-girl, anyway? 
                        Definitely not for any perverted reason, or whatever…not that it’s necessarily perverted to, you know, want 
                        a sexy character, but like, I don’t–

                    <p class="italic_text">
                        Wait, so Winnie’s like me. She feels there’s something special here with these fem Miqos. She’s the first one I’ve

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="bold_text">Calico Whiskers:</span> I get what you mean, definitely. Everyone just immediately 
                        assumes A LOT whenever they see that I’m a cat-girl<br>
                        <span class="bold_text">Winnie Pooh:</span> Right? Like, I’m not just some ERP-obsessed straight guy who 
                        dresses his character up in next-to-nothing and enjoys it a little too much, if you catch my drift.

                    <p>
                        <span class="bold_text">Winnie Pooh:</span> I’m literally a girl in her mid-twenties from Ohio who likes cute 
                        shit, there’s nothing wrong with that!<br>
                        <span class="bold_text">Calico Whiskers:</span> No not at all, and even if you were an ostensibly straight dude 
                        with a beard and tats, you don’t have to be a creep to play a cat-girl<br>
                        <span class="bold_text">Winnie Pooh:</span> Right! Well, it would be a little weird, but I’m sure those people 
                        exist somewhere out there. Like, if that were the case, then what would even be the purpose? For me, Winnie’s a 
                        reinforcement of my femininity, and so when I’m more a “girl” than a girl, I can still express that side of 
                        me here<br>
                        <span class="bold_text">Calico Whiskers:</span> What’s “girl” or girl?<br>
                        <span class="bold_text">Winnie Pooh:</span> Yeah, you know where there are just some days where you just, like, 
                        can’t be a girl that day? Where the thought of doing your hair, or your make-up, or picking out an outfit is 
                        just too much, so you exist as this quasi-girl where the only girly thing about me is my vagina (ergo “girl”)?<br>
                        <span class="bold_text">Winnie Pooh:</span> Sorry, I have this issue with being too vagina-forward, I know it 
                        makes people squeamish and I literally just met you lol<br>
                        <span class="bold_text">Calico Whiskers:</span> No, no, you’re good, I think I get what you mean<br>
                        <span class="bold_text">Winnie Pooh:</span> Yeah, so like, what would a non-creepy cishet guy get out of 
                        that experience? Like there’s nothing wrong with it if they have discovered something there, but I don’t 
                        know what it would be
                    </p>
                    <p class="italic_text">
                        What do I get out of this? Why is Calico the character I immediately gravitated towards? I don’t remember 
                        feeling any kind of, like, pull toward fem Miqo when I was making my character or anything, but it just felt, 
                        I dunno, instinctual. I’m a straight, masculine, 30-year old guy, what do I get out of playing a kawaii 
                        anime cat-girl? Should I tell Winnie? What would I even tell her? I can’t even explain it to myself.
                    </p>

                        <span class="bold_text">Winnie Pooh:</span> Ope, looks like they’re done, wanna hop in VC with the three of us?

                    <p class="italic_text">
                        VC? Oh, no, my voice, I don’t think I can. She’ll hear how deep it is then immediately know I was pretty much 
                        just talking about myself just now, and then it’ll be a whole thing, and I’m always so awkward with 
                        that stuff. Could I just like, put on an affect? Maybe sound a little less, I dunno, cishet? No, that would 
                        just create more problems. No, no, I can’t.

                        They all must be in VC, talking away. Chat’s been dead for a while, but that’s to be expected with running 
                        a dungeon, hard to battle and type at the same time. Wonder if Hiro’s mad at me. I did kinda just pull the 
                        rug out from under him, backing out of raiding. My schedule really is pretty unpredictable right now, and I do 
                        get anxious with high-end content, but Hiro’s just been rubbing me the wrong way recently. All the comments 
                        about Calico, it just never stops. What the fuck does he care? He’s basically playing a cat-boi, just an 
                        oversized, manlier one. What the fuck does it even matter? 
                    </p>
                    <p class="italic_text">
                        I think it scares him. Truly, I do. There’s something about me being so unapologetic with it that scares him. Sure 
                        I’m treading questionable, awkward water a la the owning of my character and myself and the conflagration 
                        of them both with Winnie and her friends, but not with Hiro. We’ve been gaming together for ages, hopped from 
                        game to game with the seasons. I can already tell he’s getting tired of this one too. He’s been hinting at 
                        switching to a new game that just dropped. And I get it, he’s been playing this one longer than I have, has done 
                        all the major content, and if he leaves, I wish him the best.

                    <p class="italic_text">
                        But again, there’s something about Calico that just clicks. I’m not ready to let this go yet, not to mention the 
                        fact that I’ve only been playing for like a month. Hiro had me buy story skips so I would catch up to him sooner. 
                        I hate it. He had me buy level skips too when grinding got too boring for him. I hate that too. Something about 
                        all this unnerves him. It’s uncomfortable for him. He wants to skip everything, and when he does he wants to give 
                        up. I doubt he’ll last with that static for long, he doesn’t have the patience for prog.

                    <p class="italic_text">
                        I didn’t expect to like this game as much as I do. I didn’t expect to get as involved in this game as I have. It 
                        feels personal now, in a way I can’t quite describe, and it’s all to do with Calico. And already, I can tell 
                        that these people get it like I do. Winnie, Red, and Asuna, they’re different, in a good way. A refreshing way.

                    <p class="italic_text">
                        Hiro’s a little too black and white for my taste. It’s all adrenaline and excitement with him, shooters and 
                        beat-em-ups, and physical carnage. He wouldn’t think twice about the music playing, he would’ve just gone right 
                        in and pulled the mobs to the first wall. He’s not even a good tank, despite the bravado. I love just sitting in 
                        some random zone in-game and watching Calico’s animations on loop, learning to <span class="footnote" onclick="javascript:alert('Camera mode in-game where players can manipulate various character and environment elements to take screenshots.');">gpose</span> and take screenshots, 
                        and I fucking love glams, goddamnit. Glams are the true endgame, and the only reason I’d ever even consider doing 
                        those raids is to get their glams. And I think Hiro’s worried it’ll rub off on him.

                        something’s up<br>

                        Is Red my new Hiro? I guess? Who knows what Hiro’s up to these days, haven’t spoken to him in quite a while. But 
                        I can’t say that things haven’t been pretty peaceful without him. The air feels lighter with him gone. Like here 
                        in the Steppe, high above the ground, perched on our rock pillar thing. I finally found the perfect glam, too. It 
                        all just paints a really nice little tableau.

                        With Winnie and Asuna both doing their own thing more and more, Red and I have been pretty constant companions. At 
                        least, he’s probably the person I spend the most time with in-game. I actually spend most of my in-game 
                        time these days doing pretty much nothing except <span class="footnote" onclick="javascript:alert('Orchestrions are music sheets that players can collect to play different game music tracks in their homes/inn roooms.');">orchestrion</span> and glam runs. Been saving up gil for a house, since 
                        that feels like the next logical step in my aesthetic journey I seem to be going on, but I can’t be bothered 
                        to level a crafter. Way too tedious. Though there are some nice outfits that are crafter-exclusive…One day. One day 
                        my pastel pink house will be mine.

                        Red though, Red’s always on. I don’t think I’ve ever logged on before or logged off after him. I don’t know how he 
                        does it, or what he does while he’s on. Takes the game way more seriously than I ever could, and I respect the 
                        hell out of it.

                        He’s weird today, though. Very weird. I’ve got an eye for these things. Sits a few <span class="footnote" onclick="javascript:alert('Ilms are roughly equal to inches.');">ilms</span> further from me, won’t focus 
                        on Calico or answer any of my emotes directed toward him, and I think he went to the aesthetician cause 
                        his hair’s a little less vibrantly scarlet today. It’s subtle, but it’s definitely there.

                        <span class="bold_text">Red Sand:</span> I’m thinking about taking a break<br>
                        <span class="bold_text">Calico Whiskers:</span> Oh? From the game?<br>
                        <span class="bold_text">Red Sand:</span> Yeah…a long one. Maybe a permanent one.<br>
                        <span class="bold_text">Calico Whiskers:</span> Oh, wow, uh…wow<br>
                        <span class="bold_text">Red Sand:</span> Was gonna try to just log off one of these days and not tell anyone, but 
                        I had to at least somewhat make the rounds. Felt rude not to.<br>
                        <span class="bold_text">Calico Whiskers:</span> Yeah, don’t think I ever could’ve forgiven you if you’d done that. Would’ve 
                        been a pretty dickish move haha<br>
                        <span class="bold_text">Calico Whiskers:</span> But in all seriousness, I think it’s a good idea. If that’s what 
                        you need, then that’s what you need.<br>
                        <span class="bold_text">Red Sand:</span> You’re not mad?<br>
                        <span class="bold_text">Calico Whiskers:</span> Oh please, no, that’s life. We’ll talk offline, and I’ll still be here 
                        when you get back, so it’s all good<br>
                        <span class="bold_text">Red Sand:</span> Yeah, you sticking around?<br>
                        <span class="bold_text">Calico Whiskers:</span> Absolutely, worked too damn hard to drop all this now

                        Will I ever quit? Will a day come where I log in for the last time? It’s hard to imagine that being the case, at 
                        least any time soon. I’m still figuring out the Calico side of me. It’s been less weird, but things still feel 
                        a little weird sometimes. She feels like something I’m working towards, like an ideal of sorts, but I’m still not 
                        quite there.

                    <p class="italic_text">
                        I made Calico almost subconsciously, not realizing just how important she was, how much I needed her to exist. This 
                        was supposed to be just another stupid game that Hiro and I would play occasionally, get bored of when the 
                        octane thrills died down, and throw away. And yet here I am, sitting on a rocky pillar, overlooking this pastoral 
                        majesty, a cat-girl with the perfectly tuned outfit I’ve been chasing after for two years, and I feel more me 
                        than I ever have.
                    </p>
                    <p class="italic_text">
                        Calico is me. Not in a weird way, but in a way that still feels weird. And no, that sentence still doesn’t really 
                        make any sense to me, but it’s the truth. So yeah, Red, I’ll still be here. Cause as long as this cat-girl can 
                        still dye herself up some glams, the world ain’t so black and white.

                    “Another Cat-Girl” was inspired by the inverse of “Millions” where the player creates a character that is 
                    subconsciously an ideal that the player didn’t realize they were working toward becoming/realizing, flipping the queer temporality explored in "Millions" on its head. I chose to 
                    look at this through the lens of a cishet male player who decides to play as a cat-girl character for 
                    completely different reasons than stereotypes would assume. Overwhelmingly the responses I got from the survey said
                    that cat-girls, more than any other race/gender, are objectified by the straight male gaze, or they're played by
                    girls interested in kawaii culture, which I thought was a fascinating dichotomy of identities to explore.

	                This story also allowed me to explore the nature of player communication within the game, and since I used the 
                    formal device of a chatbox log, it created a means of showing the player’s internal and external thought 
                    processes. Ultimately Calico's player is on a journey of binary-breaking, realizing that gender isn’t as black and 
                    white as they may have assumed. This formal device 
                    also allowed for a look at how different kinds of players interact with the game: those that play for 
                    superficial fun, those that play for something a little deeper and more personal, and those that completely 
                    immerse themselves in the experience (best exemplified by Red, the recurring character throughout all the stories)
                    and the different associations with gender and identity that these kinds of players end up cultivating.
