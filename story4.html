                        With salt of Rubies<br>
                        A crab walks beneath the wall<br>
                        With dust of the Steppe<br>
                        A bird glides over the wall<br>
                        The gold rises to meet them<br>
                        ~~~
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Yoshi places the folded paper in his robe.<br>
                        The blue robe.<br>
                        His ears bounce slightly in the morning air as he rushes to the barracks.<br>
                        The <span class="footnote" onclick="javascript:alert('Bazaar/market district of Kugane.');">Kogane Dori</span> vendors shout at him as he kicks dust from the road up on their wares.<br>
                        He waves and bows sheepishly in penitence while also refusing to stop his sprint.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Up over the bridge to the aetheryte plaza.<br>
                        Stops at Yugi’s stall.<br>
                        Two dango, please.<br>
                        He holds the little dumplings gingerly on their sticks above his head.<br>
                        Soft steps, don’t kick the dust too high.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Yoshi crosses the next bridge north, and into the Rakuza district.<br>
                        He then turns east, stopping in front of the two guards.<br>
                        They eye him with a mixture of suspicion and exasperation.<br>
                        This is the third time this week.<br>
                        Yoshi was really hoping to catch the new guards before the shift change.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Please, sirs, an urgent message for Haruto.”<br>
                        “From whom?”<br>
                        “His father.”<br>
                        “His father?”<br>
                        “Yes, his father.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “And what relation are you to his father?”<br>
                        “Indentured servant, sirs.”<br>
                        “And what is the nature of the urgency?”<br>
                        “His father did not say, only requested I run and deliver it.”<br>
                        “As you said yesterday.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Yoshi had said it yesterday.<br>
                        Not exactly a lie, but not a whole truth.<br>
                        Though should the <span class="footnote" onclick="javascript:alert('Elite men-only samurai guard corps of Kugane, acting as police and defenders of the city. ');">Sekiseigumi</span> wish to inquire with Haruto’s father, there should be no issue.<br>
                        Haruto’s father understands.<br>
                        He was the one who suggested the dango.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of the guards, the superior, with a small sigh, nods his head toward the other.<br>
                        The other begins to walk toward the barracks.<br>
                        Sounds of the morning meal can be heard from here across the courtyard.<br>
                        And over the bridge.<br>
                        The superior guard looks at Yoshi with narrowed eyes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “If this urgency continues tomorrow, we will need to make an inquiry.”<br>
                        “Of course, sir, I will inform his father when I return.”<br>
                        “As you said yesterday.”<br>
                        “As I said yesterday.”<br>
                        …
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Yoshi sees Haruto with the guard as they slip into the sun-soaked courtyard.<br>
                        The glint of the scales on his horns catches Yoshi’s eyes immediately.<br>
                        The Sekiseigumi keep their white robes hemmed just enough to escape the dirt and dust.<br>
                        To Yoshi, it looks like Haruto is floating.<br>
                        Flying above the ground, cresting toward him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Haruto bows to the superior guard.<br>
                        The guard bows back, and the two take their leave.<br>
                        Leaving Yoshi and Haruto alone on the bridge.<br>
                        Haruto looks at Yoshi in puzzlement.<br>
                        Yoshi holds out one of the dango.<br>

                        “Another poem, Haruto?”<br>

                        “At least that we’ve seen.”<br>
                        “You’ll let us read this one, yeah?”<br>
                        “Probably not, seeing as how he’s never let us before.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The chatter grows louder, and the number of eyes on Haruto’s back continue to grow.<br>
                        He slides the poem silently into his robe.<br>
                        The red one.<br>
                        The one that all of the Sekiseigumi wear.<br>

                    <p>
                        The eyes eventually leave his back, returning to their conversations.<br>
                        He doesn’t know these men.<br>
                        They grew up together, running through the streets of Kugane.<br>
                        He grew up far north, on the plains of Azim, on the Steppe.<br>
                        He spent his childhood alone in the trading settlement of Reunion.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was only a few years ago when his father, a successful merchant, moved the family to the city.<br>
                        His father had told him to go and play with the roving gangs of merchant sons.<br>
                        Haruto did not.<br>
                        His father had told him to stop dressing in furs and start dressing in the silks of the other boys.<br>
                        Haruto did not.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In a final attempt to force his son into the mens’ circles of the city, he sent him to the barracks.<br>
                        Into the Sekiseigumi brotherhood.<br>
                        An elite guard of samurai.<br>
                        Protectors of Kugane.<br>
                        Where all the rich sons spend their early adulthood before taking over their fathers’ empires.

                        “What I wouldn’t give to take her on a stroll across the pier.”<br>
                        “Or even better, a stroll to the <span class="footnote" onclick="javascript:alert('The Bokairo Inn, a hot-spring inn on the edge of the city.');">Bokairo</span>!”<br>
                        Bawdy laughter erupts through the hall.

                    <p>
                        Haruto does not laugh.<br>
                        Nana taught him how to write poetry.<br>
                        She was the first friend he’d made in the city.<br>
                        And when Yoshi, a young fisherman’s son from <span class="footnote" onclick="javascript:alert('Small fishing settlement on a small island on the Ruby Sea.');">Isari</span>, had been hired, he’d joined them.<br>
                        Nana’s friends, girls from around the city, would also hang around.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nana’s parents were none too happy, as was Haruto’s father.<br>
                        As the children came of age, the poetry sessions were stopped.<br>
                        Nana went to work at Shiokaze with some of the other girls.<br>
                        Yoshi stayed at home with the other servant boys.<br>
                        And Haruto came to the Sekiseigumi.

                        A full year patrolling the streets with these idiots.<br>
                        His father came occasionally, but usually sent Yoshi in his stead.<br>
                        Yoshi was Haruto’s only saving grace.<br>
                    </p>

                        “Haruto, the Viera boy is here again.”<br>
                        “Again?”<br>
                        “Isn’t that three times this week or something?”<br>
                        “Isn’t that Viera their family servant?”<br>
                        “Oh stop, it’s probably nothing but some good ol innocent fun, eh Haruto?”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Haruto gets up and walks over to the guard by the door.<br>
                        He ignores the jibes and whistles and laughs.<br>
                        He and the guard slip out into the courtyard.<br>
                        Across the way he see Haruto, ginger ears pointed up toward the sun.<br>
                        The hair on their tips waving gently in the warm breeze.

                        The city lights, paired with the moon and shadows, whorl it into a navy watercolor on his chest.<br>
                        He holds two new dango.<br>
                        They’ve grown cold.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Thought I’d find you up here.”<br>
                        “Oh good you made it, I was gett–”<br>
                        “Expecting someone?”<br>
                        “I–Yeah, a friend.”<br>
                        “Guess I’m not the friend you were hoping for?”<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Red sits beside Yoshi, staring up at the moon.<br>
                        There’s an immediate awkwardness hanging in the air.<br>
                        Yoshi glances back at where Haruto should climb up from the rafters.<br>
                        Still nothing.<br>
                        Yoshi offers Red one of the dango.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “I think I’m in love with someone.”<br>
                        “Oh?”<br>
                        “A Sekiseigumi.”<br>
                        “Oh?”<br>
                        “I haven’t left Kugane since I met him.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “And he was supposed to meet you here?”<br>
                        “That’s what I told him earlier.”<br>
                        “I’m sorry.”<br>
                        “Heh, don’t be.”<br>
                        “Okay.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “I wish I was a girl.”<br>
                        “Why?”<br>
                        “Or a merchant’s son.”<br>
                        “Why?”<br>
                        “Or anything else, really.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Why?”<br>
                        “Because all of those roads would be easier in this city.”<br>
                        “How so?”<br>
                        “As a girl I could be wed to him to continue the family empire, or as a merchant’s son I could join the Sekiseigumi.”<br>
                        “Okay.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Is that all you have to say?”<br>
                        “Do you want me to say more?”<br>
                        “...No, not really, I suppose.”<br>
                        “I’m a good listener.”<br>
                        “Yes, yes you are, Red.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Why do you think this city is the way it is?”<br>
                        “I don’t know.”<br>
                        “Because <span class="footnote" onclick="javascript:alert('The Mother Crystal, main god of the world that the player helps throughout the game.');">Hydaelyn</span>, and those beyond her, made it that way.”<br>
                        “Right.”<br>
                        “And when you realize just how deep these trenches run, you grow kind of disillusioned to it all.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Are you telling me I should give up?”<br>
                        “No, far from it.”<br>
                        “So then what should I do?”<br>
                        “Be the opposite of disillusioned.”<br>
                        “I’m not sure I understand.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “It’s probably too late for me, but you can figure it out.”<br>
                        “What?”<br>
                        “If you think about it from a certain orientation, this world is the whim of others.”<br>
                        “Okay…”<br>
                        “You can either get lost in that lack of control, or the take the reins within your own whims, I suppose.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Take the reins…”<br>
                        “I wasn’t able to, or maybe I never tried.”<br>
                        “I have an idea.”<br>
                        “Oh?”<br>
                        “Thank you Red, thank you for everything.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Those are all the words that are passed between them that night.<br>
                        The next hours pass slowly, each nibbling their dango.<br>
                        Yoshi knows what Red was trying to say.<br>
                        He also knows that Red didn’t want to go into detail.<br>
                        So he lets the silence fill those empty spaces.

                        The moonlight is long.<br>
                        The Ruby laps and breaks and forms<br>
                        The length on the skim.<br>
                        The bird stands in the brined surf.<br>
                        The crab has sunk to the depths.<br>
                        ~~~
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Yoshi is waiting for him.<br>
                        Haruto knows this.<br>
                        He looks up at the top of the Shiokaze, and thinks he can almost make out Yoshi’s ears.<br>
                        But it’s too dark to tell for sure.<br>
                        Haruto wants to go, but there’s something more urgent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sneaking from the barracks at night is easy enough.<br>
                        There are constant Sekiseigumi patrols, so those on watch just assume he’s late for his rounds.<br>
                        The family estate is in the <span class="footnote" onclick="javascript:alert('District made up of foreign/foreign-born merchants/companies, as well as foreign embassies/consulates.');">Ijin</span> district to the south.<br>
                        Haruto walks along the raised paths, and up and down the crisscrossing stairs.<br>
                        The palace yawns behind the wall at his flank.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Yoshi will forgive him.<br>
                        At least once he explains.<br>
                        Haruto walks through the gate of the estate and sees his father in the park.<br>
                        Father has never been one for sleeping.<br>
                        Endless nocturnal hunts across the great plains of the Steppe still hold their sway.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He sits next to his father by the pond.<br>
                        Koi swim lazily amongst the green algae and weeds.<br>
                        Lilies dot the surface, and small frogs hop from one to the other.<br>
                        Father tosses crumbs from his lap, and the fish lap them up eagerly.<br>
                        He doesn’t look at Haruto.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Father.”<br>
                        “Son.”<br>
                        “We need to talk.”<br>
                        “We do indeed.”<br>
                        “I’m leaving the Sekiseigumi.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “I’d hoped you’d say that.”<br>
                        “You did?”<br>
                        “I did.”<br>
                        “But you were the reason I joined.”<br>
                        “I was.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “So what changed?”<br>
                        “Yoshi.”<br>
                        “Yoshi?”<br>
                        “He’s gotten to me.”<br>
                        “How so?”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “When we came here from the Steppe, I was terrified for us.”<br>
                        “You were?”<br>
                        “I’d heard so many stories of newcomers becoming pariahs, of not attuning correctly.”<br>
                        “Oh.”<br>
                        “So I tried to change everything, jam us into how things are done here.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “You were willing to tear us down and build us in the city’s image?”<br>
                        “On my first visit, years before we came here, I witnessed something in the bazaar.”<br>
                        “What was it?”<br>
                        “A girl with a wooden stick, make-believing it was a Sekiseigumi katana.”<br>
                        “...”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “She waved it around and around, beating any of the boys who dared challenge her.”<br>
                        “...”<br>
                        “I thought it was marvelous, that she would be fit to join any of the clans in the <span class="footnote" onclick="javascript:alert('Traditional event on the Azim Steppe, where various clans compete to see who will lead for the coming era.');">Naadam</span>.”<br>
                        “...”<br>
                        “But as I looked around more, I noticed the faces of the adults.”

                        “They were horrified.”<br>

                    <p>
                        “Eventually a Sekiseigumi patrol passed by and confiscated the stick from the girl.”<br>
                        “...”<br>
                        “The boys she’d successfully beaten teamed up and chased her away in tears.”<br>
                        “...”<br>
                        “On my next visit I saw the same girl, this time with a group of girls.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “...”<br>
                        “They were dancing with fans, giggling up a storm, all except for her.”<br>
                        “...”<br>
                        “She’d smile when talked to, but as soon as the attention left her, I saw the soul leave her body.”<br>
                        “...”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “But there was peace.”<br>
                        “Peace…”<br>
                        “No one batted an eye, no one threw her looks, no one noticed.”<br>
                        “A soul for peace.”<br>
                        “...”

                    <p>
                        “So you chose peace over our culture, over our happiness?”<br>
                        “I thought the soul would come back, given time.”<br>
                        “Well it never did.”<br>
                        “I see that now.”<br>
                        “Because of Yoshi.”

                        “He is.”<br>
                        “I watched his soul grow, in real time.”<br>
                        “How?”<br>
                        "After you went to the barracks, he would sit wherever he could and write.”

            <h2>About:</h2>
            <p>
                This story was tied with the final story for the one I had the most fun writing. Since Kugane is the most heavily Japan-inspired 
                location in the game, I was interested in using that as the setting for a story all about how gender and sexuality are 
                presented within the game’s lore, largely removed from the player experience. The idea of the poem structure was inspired by 
                how part of the male homosocial sphere of Heian Japan was the passing of waka 
                poetry between men. And it’s these distinctions between homosociality/homosexuality/homonormativity that ended up being a fulcrum point 
                for the story. I also purposefully chose the two main characters to be a Viera male (Yoshi) and an Au Ra male (Haruto), since their respective
                stereotypes as brought forth through the survey seemed to complement the themes of the story well. Viera males were perceived to be largely queer-coded
                (second only to cat-bois due to their soft masculinity, and general submissive qualities compared to the strong and confident Viera females, which invites an interesting discussion on the queering of any masculinity that appears submissive to femininity, but I digress).
                Au Ra males are seen as the most strictly hetero-normative males in the game, and are a popular choice for straight male players, since they
                exemplify a strong, silent type, and the adrenaline-pumping action that a lot of those kinds of players look for as a power fantasy.
            </p>
            <p>
	            I took some minor creative liberties with the underlying societal norms of Kugane, since the 
                game doesn’t go terribly deep into these nuances, but I used Kugane as a traditionally homosocial environment, with 
                inter-gender friendships and social circles being generally frowned upon, as well as men and women being able to do 
                certain things, while also being barred from certain things (e.g. the Sekiseigumi). I also wanted to, somewhere in these 
                stories, examine queer relationships as portrayed via the game lore, since I find it really interesting how it's treated 
                in-universe. Nothing in the lore or world-building would suggest that same-sex/queer relationships are forbidden or 
                thought of in any negative light, but there are no examples of canonical queer relationships within the game (at least from the developer front), outside of 
                player-created relationships. The option does exist for two characters of the same sex to marry one another, but that is 
                entirely within the player realm, and has no bearing on the lore, since it's a system that exists outside of the game's narratives. So this interesting liminal space that queerness occupies 
                within the game is fascinating to me, and I wanted to juxtapose that with the sharply-defined homosociality of Kugane.
