                        Why yes, you hapless saps, that morbol <span class="footnote" onclick="javascript:alert('Another collectible item that players can collect. They appear as small animals/creatures that can be summoned and follow your character around.');">minion</span> you could just do like four runs of <span class="footnote" onclick="javascript:alert('Notorious early-game dungeon that is infamous for its poisoning mechanics and being incredibly hard on new healers.');">Aurum Vale</span> for is definitely 
                        worth 500k gil. For sure, for sure. Not like a sprout’s gonna have 500k to burn anyway, but there’s a ton of rich 
                        idiots who can’t be bothered to run that poisonous hell-hole of a dungeon, so they’ll pay out the wazoo if it 
                        means they don’t need to do something.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It’s lazy assholes like that that keep those of us in business, you know. I could never commit to actually 
                        learning crafting or gathering, cause nothing sounds more boring than sitting and executing a <span class="footnote" onclick="javascript:alert('Short script of successive actions that can be written and mapped onto a single button.');">macro</span> thousands of 
                        times in a row. They can’t either apparently cause they’re the ones that have crafting bots up and running that 
                        do all that shit for them. And because they have no morals, they’re the ones that get rich off it, and have all that 
                        extra cash to spend on my slightly inflated goods.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Okay, okay, looks like everything’s up, now time to buy up some of the cheaper stuff to drive up the average price, 
                        and there we go, gotta spend money to make money, you know…and ha, neat, someone already took the morbol.

                    <p>
                        Let’s have a look-see around the plaza, hmm, not too many potential marks tonight, most are clearly already in parties, 
                        most are <span class="footnote" onclick="javascript:alert('Best in Slot, meaning they have the best possible gear item in every armor slot for the current level of the game.');">BIS</span>, and the rest are AFK…one of the downsides of making your grifting base of operations in the endgame 
                        city, a lot less gullibility. Maybe I should log and fantasia over to my Lala girl, she’s usually pretty successful at 
                        attracting some passersby who’ll trade some gil just to see her dance and look cute, and yeah it’s a little icky, 
                        but meh, it’s all transactional.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Oh, wait, no, look, she may work…little Hyur girl, looking lost, kind of quiet, hmm, yes…probably lucky I’m already 
                        on my Hyur dude, he tends to come off as the most trustworthy, strangely enough, given his...somewhat amusing looks. Ahem.

                    <p>
                        “Excuse me, can I help you with anything?”

                    <p>
                        She’s startled, good, catching them off-guard, puts them on the back-foot immediately.

                        “Oh, um, hi, yes, uh…’Choco Bro…’do you happen to know what a fantasia is?”

                    <p>
                        Oh shit, I forgot I was in my <span class="footnote" onclick="javascript:alert('Large yellow birds acting as the mascots of the series, and often appearing as fantastical replacements for horses throughout.');">chocobo</span> suit still, fuck, should prob–wait did she just ask about fantasia? Oh fuck 
                        yeah, score. This’ll be good.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Yes, yes, call me Choco, hmm, fantasia you say…well you came to the right place, uh…”

                    <p>
                        “Asuna.”

                    <p>
                        “Asuna, yes you’ve come to the right place. I happen to know someone who specializes in procuring that exact rarity!”

                    <p>
                        “Wait, really!? You’re serious!?”

                        specifics, but I try not to ask too many questions.”

                    <p>
                        “Oh wow, um, is there a way that your friend would be able to get one for me?”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cha-ching.

                        “Oh, but of course, I’m sure, though, as I assume you’ll be expecting, it unfortunately isn’t the cheapest thing.”

                        Whoa, that was fast. Usually takes a little more encouragement and schmoozing, but hey if she’s bound and 
                        determined, all the better for me. Might even be able to crack a million with her.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Oh, that’s great, yes, yes, so the base rate I can usually work out with him is roughly 600k gil, but I don’t know when 
                        next he’ll be in the area. I know this is a big ask, but if you’d be willing and able to charter a ship, I could 
                        sail to Meracydia and find him myself?”

                    <p>
                        “How much would that cost?”

                    <p>
                        “Probably another million or so.”

                    <p>
                        “So 1.6 million gil? I’ll do it.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What!? This chick must be loaded. Fuck it, I can totally keep pushing this.

                    <p>
                        “Well that’s great news! Great news, indeed! Though I just remembered the last time he brought me one, he said the 
                        vein where he mines the crystal dust dried up. But he did say there was another vein further down, and if he had the 
                        right tools and manpower, he could tap into it quite easily.”

                        “I’ll pay it. Again, whatever it takes.”

                        “How…how much do you have anyway?”

                    <p>
                        “15,650,574 gil.”

                    <p>
                        Insert dramatic spit-take, I mean, holy shit, I–how far can I push this? She seems suspiciously gung-ho, 
                        gotta say…uh okay, think, think, um, I’m a lady, she’s probably a lady, cause who else would play a Hyur girl, uh–

                    <p>
                        “Will 10 million cover it?”

                        “Can you make it 11?”

                        “Deal.”

                    <p>
                        Holy fuck, she already has it in the trade window. Accept it. Oh my god. She legit just tripled my gil.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Thank you, Asuna, I’ll be sure to give this to my friend to put to good use.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “No, thank you, Mr. Choco, this…this is more important than you know. I’ll be awaiting news in Limsa.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Limsa? Ew, fine, I’ll give it to her in sprout central, ugh, how annoying. Also, “Mr. Choco”? First of all, Choco’s 
                        wearing a helmet and has the last name of Bro, but still, how dare she assume. Blegh. Granted, I guess I’m assuming 
                        that she’s a she, but who cares, it’s a game. It’s a transaction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ope and look she’s already gone. Well then, guess I better go get a fantasia then. Oh wow, this is gonna be oh so hard.

                        First, teleport to the moon. Second, head to the Watcher’s tower. Third, grab a fantasia.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Oh look, I’m already done.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now what.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I wonder what ever happened to that one dude who told me about this place? He was just some random dude out in the 
                        desert or something. I think I was grinding a <span class="footnote" onclick="javascript:alert('FATEs and Hunts are timed/repeating zone events that are very difficult to do solo, but offer good rewards.');">FATE or an S rank hunt</span> or, I don’t even know what I would’ve been doing 
                        out there, especially since it’s such a low level area. Anyway, here comes this dude, who’s all serious and shit and 
                        talking about how the sand named him and I was just like “okay, weirdo, can you fight?” and he just kept looking at 
                        the blasted sand instead of helping me fight. So annoying.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But then he told me something about there being a massive secret stash of stuff on the moon in the Watcher’s tower. 
                        And that’s when my ears perked up. There was actually something to this taking-game-way-too-seriously weirdo. 
                        I hadn’t done much exploration of the moon yet cause MSQ is boring as fuck, but I thought why the hell not and 
                        ported out of there.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lo and behold, the dude was on to something, cause I search the Watcher’s tower top to bottom, and find the motherlode 
                        of fantasias, just sitting there. Guess the devs must have forgotten to patch it or something. Usually you can 
                        only get fantasia on the mogstation, so there’s really not much use in selling them in-game, but there were countless 
                        of em down there, so I changed my entire business model.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It’s these saps’ own fault if they don’t know how common and easy to get these things are. If they’re gonna get deep 
                        and analytical about some pixels, then who am I to stop them? Just give me some money first, and we can make something 
                        work!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This girl, Asuna, she’s probably only just heard of fantasias, and thinks they’re some rare, one-time only thing. 
                        And yeah, there’s a sidequest hidden away in backwater <span class="footnote" onclick="javascript:alert('Sea of Clouds, a mid-level zone that is usually pretty empty and useless once you reach end-game.');">SoC</span> or some place that gives you a free one, and it’s the only 
                        one in the game like that, but you can literally buy as many as you want with real money. Like, come on people, use 
                        your brains.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It’s what I’ve been doing this whole time. Certain people respond more to different races and genders, so I keep a 
                        little stockpile to myself, and switch Choco up as need be. I’ve got twenty saved appearances, so if I need, say, an

                        The fun part is that everyone just assumes I’m a dude, cause marketboard manipulators and trolls tend to be dudes, 
                        and I just let em think that. Hence the Bro last name. Better they hurl that kind of abuse than the abuse they’d throw 
                        if they knew I was a girl. But I’ve got thick skin. So joke’s on them. I just post their diatribes to me and my 
                        friends’ Discord server and we just laugh.

                        See, my friends and I, we like to think we’re the fun kind of trolls, I guess. You know, we all have stupid names, we 
                        do stupid glams, use fun <span class="footnote" onclick="javascript:alert('Modifications to the game files that are player-made and are technically against terms and conditions, but as long as players do not talk about them in-game are not usually policed heavily.');">mods</span>, take the piss out of everything. Cause at the end of the day, we’re all just playing a big 
                        dumb game and having fun. No reason to take things too too seriously.

                        And I’m not cheating people out of real money, or anything, just in-game shit. Gil is literally worthless if you 
                        turn the power off.

                        Ugh, how much time is enough time!? Maybe I’ll log off and like make a snack or sleep or something. Also have to head 
                        out for some errands. Hope Asuna’s not stressing too much, or anything. She knows she can turn the game off and take a 
                        breather, yeah? She seemed really desperate for this.

                        Cool, she says to meet her in the Drowning Wench. Guess we’re really role-playing this shady deal. May as well play it 
                        up. I think I have a glam with a dark cloak in here somewhere. Meh, sure, this’ll work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Alright, let’s teleport over to Limsa. God, why’d they have to put the tavern so far from the aetheryte? Limsa got it 
                        right with the marketboards being right there, but the fact that the tavern, and therefore the inn, the only place where 
                        you can access your glamour dresser, mind you, is stupidly far, is a travesty of epic proportions and I won't stand for it, except I will cause while I may be a troll, I am a powerless troll.

                        Alright, right down to business, she really wants this thing. Jeez. Guess I’ll slink into the seat across from her 
                        and act all kooky and mysterious or whatever. All the game’s a stage, all the Hyurs and Cat-things merely players.

                        I’ll just give her a flash of it in my bag to tantalize her. This is too fun, don’t wanna get to dessert before the main

                        And there she goes, instead of answering me, she just goes and looks aimlessly at anything but me. Got it. Guess I went 
                        a little too creepy with the glam? Should I have fantasiaed? Nah, that would’ve made the aire of rarity a little less 
                        precious. Gotta keep my eyes on the pr–

                        Holy fuck, this girl’s close to tears. Jeez this is…this is getting way too real. I’m out. Toss the phial at her, 
                        and teleport the fuck out of there. Enjoy, Asuna, hope that helps…all this *gestures wildly*

                        Anyway, think I’ll switch back to my cat-boi and go troll some poor sprouts in MSQ rolo. The Discord’s gonna LOVE this.

                <h2>About:</h2>
                <p>
                    This was the last story I wrote for the collection, and I envision it as kind of a counter-argument to the other stories, 
                    which generally take the player/character relationship quite seriously. Choco’s player sees no relationship between her gender 
                    and her character’s identity. As she says, it’s a big dumb game, and her use of fantasia is purely for transactional purposes. 
                    While it’s definitely the most comedic story, I think this perspective of irreverence is actually possibly the most queer of 
                    them all, since while Choco doesn’t occupy as obviously liminal a gender/sexuality as, say, Red, Choco is, at all times, all races 
                    and all genders, with no significance attached to any of them, which throws any semblance of normativity out the window.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think this is also a good time to touch on how I chose the look of each of these characters (considering I used fantasia
                    on my character several times in order to capture story screenshots). For most of the characters, this was
                    pretty easy, since I used in-story descriptions I wrote to model them, or based them on the characters' or players' personalities.
                    Choco presented a unique challenge in that, in essence, his entire existence is, for lack of a better term, designed to take
                    the piss out of the game's systems, utilizing the same freedoms that Red criticizes in the next story to his benefit. In the customization
                    menu I chose the most ridiculous and maximalist options available, to create a character that a player would create as a joke
                    at the game's expense, which leads to an interesting discussion of what gender and racial expressions both the game and the player
                    are inclined to treat as jokes or unrealistic (though discussing realism in a fantasy game is perhaps best left to "Millions").
                    Is the bouffant hairstyle I chose meant to be treated as a joke, or are there players who attach a certain gender significance to that
                    hairstyle? It reads to me as a sort of foppish, over the top masculinity, but even the concept of 'foppish' is something that needs to
                    be dissected in how it acts as a pejorative toward certain expressions of masculinity.
